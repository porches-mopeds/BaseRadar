# BaseRadar (Built for Base)

Deployed on Base Mainnet.

Base Radar is a browser-first reference project that continuously inspects Base network state using read-only RPC calls. It is designed to validate wallet connectivity, chain targeting, and Base tooling compatibility in account abstraction–ready environments.

---

## Base ecosystem alignment

Built for Base.

Supported networks:
- Base Mainnet  
  chainId (decimal): 8453  
  Explorer: https://basescan.org  

- Base Sepolia  
  chainId (decimal): 84532  
  Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org  

The application explicitly targets Base networks and relies on official Base RPC endpoints.

## What the script does

The app.base-radar.ts script provides an in-browser interface that:

1) Connects a wallet using Coinbase Wallet SDK  
2) Reads and validates the active chainId  
3) Performs read-only Base RPC queries:
   - latest block number  
   - ETH balance of the connected address  
4) Emits a “block signal” snapshot (block number, timestamp, gas usage)  
5) Allows ETH balance checks for arbitrary addresses  
6) Prints Basescan links for verification  

No transactions are sent. All interactions are strictly read-only.

---

## Repository structure

- app.base-radar.ts  
  Browser-based script that connects to a wallet, toggles Base networks, and inspects live onchain signals.

- contracts/  
  Solidity contracts deployed to Base Sepolia for testnet validation:
  - your_contract.sol — minimal contract used to validate deployment and verification flow  
  - your_contract.sol — simple stateful contract for interaction testing  
  - your_contract.sol — lightweight contract used for read-only query validation  

- package.json  
  Dependency manifest including Coinbase SDKs and 2–5 repositories from the Base GitHub organization.

- README.md  
  Technical documentation, Base references, licensing, and testnet deployment records.

---

## Libraries used

- @coinbase/wallet-sdk  
  Wallet connection layer compatible with Coinbase tooling and Base accounts.

- viem  
  RPC client used for Base reads and block inspection.

- Coinbase GitHub repositories  
  Included as dependencies to reference the broader Coinbase open-source ecosystem.

- Base GitHub repositories  
  Included as dependencies to document linkage with Base tooling and infrastructure.

---

## Installation and execution

Install dependencies using Node.js.  
Serve the project with a modern frontend dev server and open the page in a browser.

Expected result:
- Connected address printed with Basescan link  
- Active chainId displayed (8453 or 84532)  
- Read-only Base RPC data displayed  
- Block signal snapshot available on demand

## Testnet Deployment (Base Sepolia)

As part of pre-production validation, one or more contracts may be deployed to the Base Sepolia test network to confirm correct behavior and tooling compatibility.

Network: Base Sepolia  
chainId (decimal): 84532  
Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org  

Contract #1 address:  
your_address

Deployment and verification:
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/your_address
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/your_address/0#code  

Contract #2 address:  
your_address

Deployment and verification:
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/your_address
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/your_address/0#code  

Contract #3 address:  
your_address

Deployment and verification:
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/your_address
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/your_address/0#code  

These testnet deployments provide a controlled environment for validating Base tooling, account abstraction flows, and read-only onchain interactions prior to Base Mainnet usage.
